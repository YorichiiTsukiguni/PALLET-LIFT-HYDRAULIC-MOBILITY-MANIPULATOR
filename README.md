# PALLET-LIFT-HYDRAULIC-MOBILITY-MANIPULATOR
Designed and prototyped a mobility manipulator using a syringe-based hydraulic mechanism. Converted motor-driven rotary motion into linear actuation using a threaded shaft to drive the syringe piston. Handled complete mechanical design and practical prototyping, validating motion conversion and load handling.
